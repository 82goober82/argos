# Argos â€“ Display the output of arbitrary programs in the GNOME Shell panel

Argos is a GNOME Shell extension that turns executables' standard output into panel dropdown menus. It is inspired by, and largely compatible with, the [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) app for macOS. Argos supports many [BitBar plugins](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins) without modifications.


## Installation

Clone the repository, then copy or symlink the directory `argos@pew.worldwidemann.com` into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`. Restart GNOME Shell by pressing <kbd>Alt+F2</kbd>, then entering `r`. On some systems, you may have to manually enable the Argos extension using GNOME Tweak Tool.


## Contributing

Contributors are always welcome. However, **please file an issue describing what you intend to add before opening a pull request,** *especially* for new features! I have a clear vision of what I want (and do not want) Argos to be, so discussing potential additions might help you avoid duplication and wasted work.

By contributing, you agree to release your changes under the same license as the rest of the project (see below).
